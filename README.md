# Data-Science-Projects
Some Data Science Projects I've completed in the last year

This is a Jupiter Notenook file where I perform some operations and analysis on a dataset I labeled as "my_data"

Note: the dataset in question could not be included due to the size of the file, but the visuals generated from the data are still visible.
